# SSL, TLS, HTTPS

(S)ecure (S)ocket (L)ayer is technology that can be used to secure/encrypt web communication. Initially introduced in 1995 by netscape. after version 3, SSL was rebranded as (T)ransport (L)ayer (S)ecurity. Currently, most websites use TLS v1.2 (v1.3 is in progress).
If TLS is set up properly, we can use HTTPS instead of HTTP. 

When we connect to a website using HTTPS, our traffic is automatically encrypted, so people snooping on our traffic can't read the URLs we visit, data we submit in forms, etc.
HTTPS also gives the visitor a guarantee that the website they're visiting is what it says it is.
